> ðŸ§  This project helped me deeply understand DOM manipulation, modular JavaScript, Fetch API, data separation, and content scalability.

## ðŸ“š My Learning Journey

This project started as a simple multi-page HTML setup, but evolved dramatically as I learned new web development skills. Here's how my approach changed step-by-step:

1. âœ… **Basic Multi-Page HTML Setup**  
   Initially, I created separate `.html` files for each section and used `<iframe>` to render the main content on the same page. It worked but was repetitive and hard to maintain.

2. âœ… **Dynamic Rendering with JavaScript**  
   After learning JavaScript, I refactored the project to use a **single `index.html`**, dynamically rendering content based on user interaction and URL parameters. This made the UI smoother and code cleaner.

3. âœ… **Using Fetch API to Load JSON Data**  
   I started storing all logic-building questions in local `.json` files and learned to fetch them dynamically based on the selected language and topic using `fetch()`.

4. âœ… **Separating Data Using GitHub as a JSON Host**  
   To keep the project more scalable and maintainable, I moved all JSON data into another GitHub repository and started **fetching raw files directly from there**.  
   Now, I just need to update the data once in that repo, and the content auto-updates in this dashboard â€” no need to touch the UI.
